# What is Laps?

## Laps tracks the time you spend on your tasks.

Laps is a time tracker you can use within the shell. It asks you what you're working on, accepts commands, and displays a breakdown of each task and its time. 

Once you're done, you can reflect and add comments after laps breaks down your day. The breakdown includes the time you spent on each task, the total time spent on repetitive tasks, and the total spent using the program. 

You can start and a task as you work on it, enter a task and time manually, cancel tasks, and rename the current task. 

It writes your tasks, times, comments, and some other data to a a readable text file. Each time you use Laps, it appends this file and adds your last session to your history for you to view or edit later.  

# Installation and Use

After downloading, you can run the binary file on a Mac. If you're on Windows and have python installed, you can run the py file instead.

Commands are not case-sensitive. Same goes for task names. Currently, the 'Laps-history' text file will be created in your laps directory. 

The binary file was created using PyInstaller. PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package.
