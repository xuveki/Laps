# What is Laps?

## Laps tracks the time you spend on your tasks.

Laps is a time tracker you use within the shell. It asks you what you're working on, accepts commands, and displays a breakdown of each task and its time. 

When you tell Laps that you're done, it will prompt you to add comments before breaking down your day. The breakdown includes the time you spent on each task, the total time spent on repetitive tasks, and the total spent using the program. 

It writes your tasks, times, comments, and more to a text file in a readable fashion. Each time you use Laps, it appends this file and adds your last session to your history for you to view or edit later.  

# Installation and Use

After downloading, you can run the exec file which will create and write to a .txt file in the same directory during first use. If you're on Windows, you can run the py file instead.

Commands are not case-sensitive. Same goes for task names. Currently, the 'Laps-history' text file will be created in the same directory as the exec file. Functionality and features such as cancelling a task, editing a task name or time while the program is running, and more are on the to-do list.

# Compiling

The binary file was created using Auto Py to Exe (GUI for PyInstaller). PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. If you're on Windows and you have Python installed, you can use the .py file. More accessible solutions to come.
